            <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>     
            <p>The data set is about the speculated academic performance of junior Filipino high school students.          
                <br><br> In the data set, we are welcomed with, first, the individuals from different schools and the variables we surveyed from them. This includes the school the respondent is previously studying in, their grade level last school year, their average grade, and their study hours per day. The class is spread out to 17 different Filipino junior high schools with 64 total respondents in. It is  mainly focused in the scope of Davao Region.          
                <br><br>Onto the topic of the data’s experimental unit, it is classified as a population of different students from different schools in our speculated scope of circle.         <br><br>In terms of why we had the final choice as this for the topic of our data, is mainly because, we, ourselves are students, and are curious to know how the different school systems are doing. We mainly wanted to know the current situations of other students outside of our own study place, leading us up to digitally survey some variables out of our scope.</p>

Aguinaldo National High School, telling us that most of the students we surveyed study here, with a total number of 26. The six smallest slices are the schools with the least frequent responses, indicating that we had 1 each of respondents that study from Catalunan Pequeno National High School, Davao City National High School, Ma-a National High School, Mary Mediatrix Academy Incorporated, Philippine Women’s College of Davao, and Sto. Nino National High School.             
                    <br><br>In the bar graph, the one that stands out the most is the most frequent in our data set: the Daniel R. Aguinaldo National High School. We can also easily see the smallest five, as they are all in the same level, which are the least frequent in our data set: the Catalunan Pequeno National High School, Davao City National High School, Ma-a National High School, Mary Mediatrix Academy Incorporated, Philippine Women’s College of Davao, and Sto. Nino National High School.

                    <p>To interpret the mean, median, and standard deviation for this data set, among the mean and median, the median is the most appropriate center to use. To answer why, it is because the shape of the distribution is skewed. At some times, the mean may be misinterpreted, especially when there are extreme values for skewed distributions. As for this case, since there are outliers, the median is the best to use. For the standard deviation, which tells us how far the values are relative from the mean, we have a result of 3.51, and that determines that the data set is not that spread out.</p>

                    <p>Looking at the boxplot, we can see that the median is leaning more towards the right, giving us more confirmation that the shape of the distribution is indeed skewed to the left. The interquartile range (IQR) of our data set, which is the difference between quartile 3 and quartile 1, is 3.25. As mentioned in the previous section, there are outliers in this data set. When calculating the lower fence and upper fence, we get 84.87% and 97.88%, respectively. Since we have values outside of those fences, namely 84% by one respondent, 83% by two respondents, 80% by one respondent, and 98% by one respondent, we can consider them as outliers. In total, there are five (5) outliers in this data set.

                    <p>Interpreting the mean, median, and the standard deviation of this data set, we can see that the mean is the central value of the data set, which also states that on the average the data points are estimated to be 3.11 units. For the median on the other hand, it has the other half of the data set to be equal with the other side of the quartile. For the standard deviation, since it has a lower deviation, the standard deviation of this data set is most likely relatively close to the mean. To summarize the point, the data set suggests a moderate spread of values, not too widely dispersed from the mean for an easier say, making the data set relatively consistent.

                    <p>This is a histogram on the study hours per day of the students we surveyed. Its components contain the frequency of this variable and its class boundaries. The histogram has a skewed to the right shape, therefore it is positively skewed since its tail is on the right part of the distribution.

                    <p>The skewness of the data set, if we base it on the plot above, shows the slight asymmetry of the distribution of data. It is rather a relative balance, but it has a lean of a skewed to the right plot, therefore it is positively skewed. For the IQR on the other hand, it tells us that the data falls within the concentrated range of 2.25, spanning from 2-4.25 hours, which indicates that the central part of the data set is quite consistent. In the topic of outliers, we can analyze the lower and upper bound of the set. We have -1.375 hours as the lower bound and 7.125 hours as the upper bound, and if we observe our datasets, we don't have data points that go below -1.375. Although if we look at the upper bound, we actually have data points that go beyond 7.125, which is the data point of 8 hours, currently being 2 values we have on the data set. Therefore, we have 2 total outliers in the data of study hours per day.

            <h2 class="summary"><b>Conclusion</b></h2>     
            <p>Based on the survey and analysis that we have conducted, we have concluded that most of our respondents’ academic performances are actually favorable, based on the average of the average grades, which is 92-95%, and the average time of studying at 3-5 hours per day. We can say that most of these students study for extra hours after school to get good grades, although, there may be some factors, including the schools’ grading systems, that may have affected these results. But as we are basing on the survey, the results of this are good and satisfactory. It is nice to know that high school students outside of our school are doing well in terms of their grades and study habits.
                <br><br>The making of this written report was interesting, new, and challenging, as we had to explore a lot on the platform we used, the Google Sheets, in order to accurately get the information we needed. It was a time consuming process because we were also just getting familiar with the different online tools to calculate for what we were asked. Overall, we learned a lot in applying what was taught to us in the first quarter of Statistics 1, including how to make frequency tables, identify shapes of distributions, identify centers and variability, identify the locations, and etcetera, for the making of this project. We hope to retain the knowledge we learned and apply them to our future tasks and projects that involve research and statistics.
